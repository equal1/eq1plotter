1) From a PC console window run the regression scripts to verify that 
you havn't broken anything (see regression instructions)

2) - Sos checkin the latest changes to pygram_dev.py (this will auto 
increment the version number to match the sos version number)
   - Sos update to make sure you have the latest files in you work 
area

3) From the Linux Window type: 
 cd  /projects/sw/release
 relsw.py  /projects/sw/users/$USER/pygram/src/pygram_dev.py
or
 relsw.py  /projects/sw/users/$USER/pygram/src/pygram_dev.py V

This will copy the pygram_dev.py from the users work are into the 
release directory and renamve the version number prefix from 'dev' to 'X'
If the 'V' parameter is provided then the 'V' version is released also.
